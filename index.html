            <h4>About me</h4>
            <p>I&#39;m a bit of a modern day nomad &#8208; enjoy travelling and not afraid to move onto new things taking on new challenges,
                going above and beyond from what it is to be expected. I have lived in 4 different countries thus far &#91;Dominican Republic,
                USA, Australia and Korea&#93; and speak 3 different languages fluently, although my brain tends to mix them up from time to 
                time. 😅</p>
            <p></p>Very hands&#8208;on and love animals and nature! Most of my work is inspired by one or the other &#126; or both! I&#39;ve had 
                a creative streak my entire life and I&#39;ve slowly moved onto incorporating it onto the technological world. I like to make things 
                from scratch (like this website!), kinda gives me a better sense of accomplishment, making me feel warm and fuzzy inside. 🤗<br>
                Currently focused on Front-end Development with HTML, CSS and Javascript, but have plans to move onto programming languages such 
                as Python and Java. </p>
            <p>I have a Bachelors in Animal and Veterinary Bioscience from the University of Sydney and currently work as an Animal Health 
                Technologist, but have worked in several different industries.</p>
